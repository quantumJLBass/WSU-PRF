<strong>POLICY</strong>
<blockquote>Washington State University is committed to providing equal opportunity in its services, programs, and employment for individuals with disabilities. The University complies with federal and state laws (e.g., <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.60"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">RCW 49.60</span></span></a>) and regulations (e.g., <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=357-26"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">WAC 357-26</span></span></a>) regarding reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities.

This policy sets forth guidelines for meeting reasonable accommodation requirements of state and federal laws. See <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.21_Reasonable_Accommodation.htm#statutes"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a>. The reasonable accommodation process is subject to flexibility within governing law.</blockquote>
<strong>Purpose</strong>
<blockquote>The University's reasonable accommodation process is designed to:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Assist individuals with disabilities (impairments) with applying for employment,</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure equal access to employment, and</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Help individuals remain in their jobs or appointments, with or without accommodations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<strong>Applicability</strong>
<blockquote>This policy is applicable to all employees, appointees, candidates, and applicants for employment with Washington State University. It provides reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities in accordance with <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.60.040"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">RCW 49.60.040</span></span></a> and other applicable state and federal laws. See also "Definitions" <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.21_Reasonable_Accommodation.htm#definitions"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a>.

Persons with disabilities have the right to request and receive reasonable accommodation in all aspects of employment procedures with the University, including but not limited to application, recruitment, selection/hiring, promotion, testing, medical examinations, layoff/recall, assignments, termination, evaluation, compensation, disciplinary processes, leave, training, employee benefits including insurance, and employer-supported activities.</blockquote>
<strong>Reasonable Accommodation </strong>
<blockquote>Reasonable accommodation means modification or adjustment to a job, work environment, policy, practice, or procedure that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunity and that does not impose an undue hardship on the employer.

In accordance with <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=357-26-015"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">WAC 357-26-015</span></span></a>, reasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Accommodation in application procedures, testing, and interview processes; or</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Modifications or adjustments to a job, work method, or work environment that make it possible for a qualified person with a disability to:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Perform the functions of the position, or

Enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment equal to employees without disabilities.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<strong>Contact Staff </strong>
<blockquote>Trained HRS staff have the authority necessary to initiate the University's reasonable accommodation process.</blockquote>
<strong>ACCOMMODATION PROCESS</strong>

<strong>Notification</strong>
<blockquote>The University must provide each employee who requests reasonable accommodation with access to the University's reasonable accommodation procedure in a format that is accessible to that employee in accordance with <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=357-26-020"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">WAC 357-26-020</span></span></a>.

The University must include notification of the right to make a reasonable accommodation request and information on how to initiate such a request with all recruitment efforts.

A person in the employee's supervisory hierarchy should refer the employee to Human Resource Services (HRS) to discuss the availability of reasonable accommodation under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>When he or she becomes aware of the employee's impairment(s), and</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If it reasonably appears that the impairment may have a substantially limiting affect on the employee's ability to perform his or her job or enjoy access to equal benefits, privileges, or terms and conditions of employment.</li>
</ul>
HRS recommends that the supervisor also notify HRS of the referral.

The referral recommendations above are not meant to impair an employee's rights to seek reasonable accommodation on his or her own, nor to alter protections set forth in this policy and under law.</blockquote>
<strong>Requesting Accommodation</strong>

Employee Responsibilities
<blockquote>Unless the employer has received notice of the impairment, it is the employee's responsibility to inform the supervisor or HRS that he or she needs a reasonable accommodation in order to perform her or his job functions or to receive equal benefits, privileges, or terms and conditions of employment.

The employee is responsible for providing current information concerning her or his medical condition, skills, abilities, training, and experience to HRS as part of the reasonable accommodation request.</blockquote>
Department Responsibilities
<blockquote>The supervisor should inquire whether the employee perceives a need for reasonable accommodation when:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The employer has received notice of the impairment, and</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The impairment is reasonably believed to interfere with job functions or access to equal benefits, privileges, or terms and conditions of employment currently or in the future.</li>
</ul>
Since impairments may change over time, a single inquiry does not relieve the employer or the employee from the potential for ongoing discussion or engagement in an interactive process.

NOTE: The supervisor must be careful to avoid an improper inquiry about the employee's possible impairment and to protect the employee's right to privacy. See <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.08_Preemployment_Inquiry_Guidelines.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">60.08</span></span></a> regarding applicants. <strong>The supervisor should contact HRS for assistance with this process. </strong>Supervisors are not to request medical documentation regarding the impairment or discuss the specifics of the medical diagnosis with the employee. HRS is responsible for maintaining medical documentation needed in the reasonable accommodation process.</blockquote>
<strong>Qualifying for Reasonable Accommodation in Employment</strong>
<blockquote>For the purposes of qualifying for reasonable accommodation in employment, the employee and the employer must participate in an interactive process.
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The employee and her or his health care provider must provide documentation to HRS indicating that a disability or medical impairment is known or shown to exist in fact; <strong>and</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The impairment must have a substantially limiting effect upon the individual's:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Ability to perform his or her job,
Ability to be considered for a job, or
Access to equal benefits, privileges, or terms and conditions of employment; <strong>and</strong></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>The existence of the impairment and the medical documentation must establish a reasonable likelihood that engaging in job functions without an accommodation would aggravate the impairment to the extent that it would create a substantially limiting effect. (All medical documentation is to be provided to HRS. See <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.21_Reasonable_Accommodation.htm#medical"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a>.)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>NOTE: A limitation is not substantial if it has only a trivial effect. (<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.60.040"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">RCW 49.60.040(25)(d)(e)</span></span></a>)</blockquote>
The obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation applies to all aspects of employment. This duty is ongoing and may arise any time that a person's disability/impairment or job changes.

Behavior related to a disability must be examined in the context of possible eligibility for reasonable accommodation before an employee may be subject to discipline or other adverse employment action as a result.</blockquote>
Timely Response
<blockquote>Timely response to a reasonable accommodation request is essential in providing equal opportunity. Failure of a department to provide reasonable accommodation in a timely manner is justification for an applicant for a position to be granted an extension of application or other applicable deadlines to be considered for the applicant/employee.</blockquote>
Documentation

<em>Request Form </em>
<blockquote>To make a written reasonable accommodation request, the employee or applicant completes and submits an Accommodation Request for Disability or Serious Medical Condition form to HRS. Obtain copies of the form by completing and/or printing the blank master on <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/PDF/BPPM/60-21-18.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">60.21.18</span></span></a>.

NOTE: Completion of a request form may not always be necessary. However, completion is recommended to assist HRS and the department with maintaining an accurate record of the request and action taken. If the employee fails to complete an Accommodation Request for Disability or Serious Medical Condition form, HRS may request the employee to do so. An employee who makes a verbal request may be asked to complete written documents. HRS provides assistance with completing the written documents if reasonable accommodation for such completion is required.</blockquote>
<em><a name="medical"></a>Medical Documentation </em>
<blockquote>HRS may request that the employee provide written documentation from a licensed health care provider (HCP), including a statement of the employee's functional limitations or substantially limiting effects. This documentation may also include the HCP's recommendations about potential alterations or adjustments to the job functions.

Use the following forms, as needed, to request and obtain written documentation from a health care provider:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Medical Release Statement for Reasonable Accommodation Requests on <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/PDF/BPPM/60-21-19.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">60.21.19</span></span></a>, and</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Health Care Provider Statement for Reasonable Accommodation Requests on <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/PDF/BPPM/60-21-20-24.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">60.21.20-24</span></span></a>. The health care provider statement includes a work assessment section.</li>
</ul>
Refusal by the employee to provide adequate medical documentation may result in denial of reasonable accommodation or separation from employment.</blockquote>
<strong>Review of Request</strong>

HRS Review/Consultation
<blockquote>Upon receiving the reasonable accommodation request, HRS reviews the current position description, the position's functions, and qualifications.

HRS contacts the department and employee once the completed request is received. HRS may request additional information. The employee may also schedule an appointment with HRS on his or her own initiative.</blockquote>
<em>With Employee </em>
<blockquote>Human Resource Services consults with the individual to:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Discuss his or her specific sensory, mental, and/or physical abilities and limitations in relation to the job functions;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Identify the disability-related barriers to job performance and current or potential substantially limiting effects;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Assess how reasonable accommodation may overcome these barriers; and</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Discuss the employee's preferences with regard to reasonable accommodation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<em>With Department </em>
<blockquote>The department, in consultation with HRS, may consider a reasonable accommodation for job functions or elimination or adjustment of certain functions. See <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.21_Reasonable_Accommodation.htm#determine"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a> regarding determination of functions.</blockquote>
Verification
<blockquote>The University through HRS may request that an applicant or employee provide verification from a health care professional (HCP) when he or she requests an accommodation and:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The disability is not readily apparent or understandable without HCP input;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The disability has not been previously documented;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The reasonableness of the request is not evident; and/or</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Medical documentation is required to establish a substantially limiting effect or a reasonable likelihood that engaging in job functions without an accommodation would aggravate the impairment to the extent that it would create a substantially limiting effect.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<em>HCP Opinion </em>
<blockquote>The University through HRS may request the health care professional's opinion as to whether or not:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The employee or applicant has sensory, mental, and/or physical impairment as claimed;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The impairment has the effect of necessitating reasonable accommodation in that it has a substantially limiting effect on the individual's:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Ability to perform his or her job,
Ability to apply or to be considered for a job, or
Access to equal benefits, privileges, or terms and conditions of employment;</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The employee or applicant is able to perform the functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>A reasonable likelihood exists that engaging in job functions without a reasonable accommodation would aggravate the impairment to the extent that it would create a substantially limiting effect; and/or</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The requested accommodation is appropriate to the disability.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<em>Second Opinion</em>
<blockquote>The University may obtain a second opinion from a health care professional chosen and paid for by the employing department. Such inquiries are limited to:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Verification of the employee's claims;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Comments on the appropriateness of the requested accommodation; and/or</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Suggestions of possible effective alternative accommodations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<em>Medical Examination and/or Certification</em>
<blockquote>The University may require a medical examination and/or health care professional's certificate where a question arises concerning the fitness of a current employee to perform the duties of his or her position. The employing department pays the cost of the medical examination and/or certificate.</blockquote>
<strong><a name="determine"></a>Determining Reasonable Accommodation</strong>
<blockquote>HRS consults with the supervisor, the employee, and if applicable, a vocational professional if the disability:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Precludes the employee from performing job functions,</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Substantially limits the individual's ability to perform his or her job, or</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Is reasonably likely to substantially limit the individual's ability to perform his or her job without reasonable accommodation.</li>
</ul>
The consulting group undertakes the following actions, as appropriate:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Evaluation of the employee's functional abilities and limitations;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Analysis of the job requirements;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Exploration of reasonable accommodation options available to enable the employee to perform the job's functions, including but not limited to:
<blockquote>Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to be used by the employee with an impairment or impairments;

Restructuring the job in a manner consistent with reasonable accommodation;

Granting a leave of absence in a manner consistent with law;

Modifying work schedules in a manner consistent with law;

Acquiring or modifying equipment or devices, in accordance with law;

Providing qualified readers and interpreters;

Reviewing current vacancies within the department; and/or

Providing the opportunity for reassignment to an active vacant position.</blockquote>
</li>
	<li>Determination of the most effective reasonable accommodations;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Evaluation concerning whether or not the employee can perform the job in a manner safe to others and the employee.</li>
</ul>
For any questions concerning the nature of the limitation or a reasonable accommodation being considered, the employee and/or the supervisor should consult with HRS. HRS may also consult with other knowledgeable sources. All parties are obligated to engage in the reasonable accommodation process in such instances.</blockquote>
HRS and Department Evaluation
<blockquote>HRS and the department evaluate the suggested accommodation(s) by assessing:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The effectiveness of the proposed accommodation in enabling the employee to perform the job functions;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The operational needs of the department; and</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The cost of the proposed accommodation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<em>Considerations</em>
<blockquote>HRS and the department consider the following factors, as appropriate:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The number of persons employed in the department.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The number, type, and locations of the units within the department.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The type of operation, including:
<blockquote>The composition, structure, and functions of the department's workforce,
The department's geographic separateness, and
The administrative or fiscal relationship of the department to the campus;</blockquote>
</li>
	<li>Impact of the proposed accommodation on:
<blockquote>The operation of the department,
The ability of other employees to perform their duties,
The department's ability to conduct business.</blockquote>
</li>
	<li>The nature and cost of the proposed accommodation.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The overall financial resources of the University with respect to the number of employees and the number, type, and location of University facilities;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The effect on expenses and resources or other impact of the proposed accommodation on business operations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<em>Undue Hardship Limitation </em>
<blockquote>The University must provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless doing so imposes an undue hardship. However, before concluding that a particular accommodation would impose an undue hardship, the University must consider whether or not there are alternative reasonable accommodations that would not impose such a hardship.

NOTE: Determinations of "undue hardship" may be made only by the appropriate dean or vice president after consultation with HRS. Such determinations must be documented in writing with the appropriate signatures. See also <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.21_Reasonable_Accommodation.htm#hardship"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a>.</blockquote>
<strong>Accommodation Options</strong>
<blockquote>The supervisor and HRS review any selected reasonable accommodation options with the employee, as necessary. Dialogue concerning reasonable accommodation may be ongoing and may involve members of the employee and supervisor's supervisory hierarchy, as well as other relevant University officials.</blockquote>
Accommodation to Position
<blockquote>If two or more effective accommodations exist, and after considering the preference of the individual with a disability, the University may select the reasonable accommodations to be provided.</blockquote>
Placement in Alternate Position
<blockquote>The University attempts to place an employee with a documented disability in an equivalent or lower status vacant position for which the employee qualifies if:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The employee is no longer able to perform the functions of his or her position with or without reasonable accommodation;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Medical documentation establishes a reasonable likelihood that engaging in job functions without a reasonable accommodation would aggravate the impairment to the extent that it would create a substantially limiting effect and no reasonable accommodation for the position exists; and/or</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Accommodation in the present position would cause an undue hardship (see <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.21_Reasonable_Accommodation.htm#hardship"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a>).</li>
</ul>
Generally, placement under this policy is without competition. However, an employee covered by this policy may compete with other similarly-situated candidates for the same nonpromotional position. The employee must meet the minimum qualifications and specific position requirements for any vacant position offered as a reasonable accommodation. The employee must meet those position requirements with or without a reasonable accommodation.

Under this policy, the University is <strong>not</strong> required to:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Create a position,</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Displace another employee,</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Offer a promotion, or</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Move an employee into a position for which the employee is not qualified.</li>
</ul>
Refusal by the employee to cooperate with the placement efforts or to provide adequate medical documentation may result in separation or the employee not receiving reasonable accommodation.</blockquote>
Individual Options
<blockquote>If the cost of a reasonable accommodation imposes an undue hardship and there are no other financial resources available, the University gives the individual with a disability the option of providing the accommodation, or paying that portion of the cost which constitutes an undue hardship.

Individuals should consult with HRS in those situations where the employee or his or her supervisor seeks an adjustment.</blockquote>
No Accommodation Selected

<em>By Department </em>
<blockquote>The department should discuss with HRS any suggested accommodations that appear to be unacceptable. This determination includes an evaluation of undue hardship. See <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.21_Reasonable_Accommodation.htm#hardship"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a>.

A reasonable accommodation identified or adopted by the parties as acceptable may not be rejected or ceased by a department as an undue hardship without involving HRS.

The department should consult with HRS prior to ceasing any previously approved or pursued reasonable accommodation, including those cases where the potential action appears to be consensual between the employee and supervisor.</blockquote>
<em>Written Justification </em>
<blockquote>The University provides written justification, signed by the appropriate dean or vice president, to the individual for any decision not to provide a reasonable accommodation because of undue hardship.</blockquote>
<em>By Employee </em>
<blockquote>A qualified individual with a disability has the right to refuse a reasonable accommodation. (See <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/60_Personnel/60.21_Reasonable_Accommodation.htm#qualified"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a> for the definition of a qualified individual with a disability.)

However, if the individual refuses the reasonable accommodation and is unable to perform the job functions without the accommodation, he or she is not then considered to be a qualified individual with a disability. In this case, the employee may be separated from employment.</blockquote>
Disability Separation
<blockquote>A disability separation is an action taken to separate an employee from service when the employer determines that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position or class with or without reasonable accommodation due to mental, sensory, or physical incapacity. Disability separation is not a disciplinary action.

<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY </strong>
<blockquote>By law, medical information received by the University is confidential (subject to certain limited exceptions). Such information is maintained separate from the personnel records.

Reasonable accommodation medical records for all University employees and affected others (e.g., applicants seeking reasonable accommodation) are retained in HRS, in files separate from personnel or benefits records which are unrelated to reasonable accommodation.

Each department, including HRS, must treat all information regarding the presence or nature of an employee's or applicant's disability as confidential medical records. The department must forward such records to HRS.

<strong>Employee Disclosure </strong>
<blockquote>Individuals are not required to reveal diagnoses or the details of medical treatments to immediate supervisors or to coworkers. However, some persons voluntarily choose to share this information with others. While someone may voluntarily choose to share some information about his/her condition, supervisors must understand that:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The information should still be considered confidential; and</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A person who has shared some information at a particular time may later decide that she or he longer wishes to discuss the condition or treatment. Such a decision must be respected.</li>
</ul>
Employees may be expected to provide medical information to HRS or other University representatives who have responsibility for assisting with the reasonable accommodation process.</blockquote>
<strong>Health Care Provider Information</strong>
<blockquote>If an employee gives to his or her supervisor written information or requests from his or her health care provider, the supervisor is to immediately forward the documents(s) to HRS.</blockquote>

<strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong>

<strong> Selection Criteria </strong>
<blockquote>University departments are obligated to ensure that qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria do not screen out or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities unless such criteria are job-related and consistent with business necessity.

University departments are obligated to use employment tests in the most effective manner to measure actual abilities. Tests used must accurately reflect the skills, aptitude, or other factors being measured. Tests used are not to reflect the impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills of an employee or applicant with a disability (unless those are the skills the test is designed to measure and such skills are consistent with business necessity).</blockquote>
<strong>Equal Terms, Benefits, Privileges, and Conditions of Employment</strong>
<blockquote>The University provides reasonable accommodations to enable an employee with a disability to enjoy terms, benefits, privileges, and conditions of employment equal to those enjoyed by a similarly-situated employee without impairment(s) or disability(ies).

The need for a reasonable accommodation is <strong>not</strong> to be a factor in the selection of an employee for promotion, training, travel, participation in projects, committees, or any opportunity which may have an impact on the employee's career development.

The University provides reasonable accommodations to enable an employee with a disability to have the opportunity to enjoy all employer-supported social or recreational activities.

Timelines for all activities and opportunities covered under this section must allow adequate opportunity for arranging reasonable accommodations.</blockquote>

<h2>Gift Transmittals</h2>
<strong>ROUTING GIFTS</strong>
<blockquote>University departments route all gifts from private sources to the Gift Accounting division of the WSU Foundation for acceptance, deposit, receipting, and acknowledgment. If the responsible college or area has a development office, the department submits all gifts to the development office. The development office then routes gifts to Gift Accounting.

Gift Accounting processes monetary gifts and noncash gifts (tangible items, e.g., equipment). Each gift category is processed on a different form. See <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/30_Finance/30.70_Gift_Transmittal.htm#gifttrans"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">below</span></span></a> for procedures and forms for submitting monetary or noncash gifts.

The department or the development office must route the applicable forms with the gifts to Gift Accounting.</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The donor specifies that the contribution is to be a charitable gift.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<strong>Not Included as Gifts</strong>
<blockquote>Gifts to the University do not include sponsored project solicitations. To determine whether or not a contribution is considered a sponsored project solicitation or a gift solicitation, contact Gift Accounting for information.
