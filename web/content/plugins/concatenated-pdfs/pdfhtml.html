<h2>Gift Transmittals</h2>
<strong>ROUTING GIFTS</strong>
<blockquote>University departments route all gifts from private sources to the Gift Accounting division of the WSU Foundation for acceptance, deposit, receipting, and acknowledgment. If the responsible college or area has a development office, the department submits all gifts to the development office. The development office then routes gifts to Gift Accounting.

Gift Accounting processes monetary gifts and noncash gifts (tangible items, e.g., equipment). Each gift category is processed on a different form. See <a href="#gifttrans">below</a> for procedures and forms for submitting monetary or noncash gifts.

The department or the development office must route the applicable forms with the gifts to Gift Accounting.</blockquote>
<strong>Exception (Planned Gifts)</strong>
<blockquote>Planned gifts (e.g., estates) may be cash or noncash. For planned giving, contact the Gift Planning division of the WSU Foundation.</blockquote>
<strong>GIFTS DEFINED</strong>
<blockquote>Gifts have all of the following characteristics:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The contribution is from a private individual or a non-governmental source and there are no contractual terms and/or conditions.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The donor specifies that the contribution is to be a charitable gift.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The donor places reasonable conditions or stipulations on the intended use of the gift. The conditions or stipulations must direct the funds to areas such as scholarships, capital improvements, the University's endowment fund, or general research of specific interest to the donor, etc.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The donor intends the gift to be irrevocable and, therefore, relinquishes the right to reclaim the gift or any unused remainder.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The donor makes the donation to the University without the expectation of direct economic benefit or other tangible benefit commensurate with the worth of the gift. Indirect benefits are not sufficient to negate the gift. Indirect benefits include tax advantages, business or personal goodwill derived from close association with the University, and miscellaneous benefits derived from the donor club status.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<strong>Not Included as Gifts</strong>
<blockquote>Gifts to the University do not include sponsored project solicitations. To determine whether or not a contribution is considered a sponsored project solicitation or a gift solicitation, contact Gift Accounting for information.

If a contribution is determined not to be a gift, submit it to the Office of Grant and Research Development (OGRD) for review, approval, and processing.</blockquote>
<strong>Types of Gifts</strong>
<blockquote>The term, "gift," may apply to any of the following:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Cash (currency, coin, checks, money orders, credit card transactions, electronic funds transfers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Securities (stocks, bonds, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Tangible noncash gifts (books, equipment, art treasures, coin collections, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Real property (homes, farms, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Mineral rights (oil wells, etc.)</li>

<strong>Cash and Checks</strong>
<blockquote>Donors should be encouraged to make checks payable to the WSU Foundation. If a check is made payable to the University, a department, or college, the check must be endorsed by the recipient office before it is transmitted to Gift Accounting.

See <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/HTML/BPPM/80_Services/80.18_Courier_Services.htm">80.18</a> for a list of courier pickup locations.</blockquote>
Courier Service Process
<blockquote>To ensure proper accountability, departments or development offices dropping off deposits to any of the courier services locations, including those at the regional campuses, <strong>must</strong> follow the procedures below.</blockquote>
<em>Envelope and Insert</em>
<blockquote>Place donated checks, cash, and accompanying gift transmittal forms <strong>with</strong> a completed Courier Service Insert slip into an envelope and <strong>seal</strong> the envelope. The envelope may include multiple gifts. Enter the total of all gifts in the envelope in <strong>Overall Total Enclosed</strong> on the Courier Service Insert.

Print the form master on <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/PDF/BPPM/30-70-18.pdf">30.70.18</a> to obtain copies of the Courier Service Insert slips.

<ul>
	<li>His or her name,</li>
	<li>Signature, and</li>
	<li>Date and time the deposit envelope is dropped off.</li>
</ul>
Print the form master on <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/PDF/BPPM/30-70-19.pdf">30.70.19</a> to obtain log sheet. See the PDF version of page <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/PDF/BPPM/30-70.pdf">30.70.4</a> for an example of the drop-off site log sheet.

The drop-off site representative gives a signed receipt to the department representative acknowledging the acceptance of the deposit envelope. (See the PDF version of page <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~forms/PDF/BPPM/30-70.pdf">30.70.4</a> for an example of the drop-off receipt.)

The receipt verifies the following information:

	<li>Drop-off site representative name,</li>
	<li>Drop-off site representative telephone,</li>
	<li>Date of drop-off, and</li>
	<li>Courier site location.</li>
</ul>
The department retains the signed drop-off receipt with the department's gift transmittal and courier service insert copies.
